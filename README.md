This is a portfolio of Prashanthi Subbiah's Data Analysis Skills.

This repository contains various projects that demonstrate my statistical and analytical skills. They are sorted into the following folders:
1. Impact Evaluation: Contains a summary and the code of an impact evaluation project I conducted for a client. The code has been altered and the dataset has not been shared for confidentiality purposes.
2. Dashboard: Contains the code and presentation of a dashboard I created to map Chicago traffic data.
